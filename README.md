## Front-end Frameworks (React)

This is the FEF (React) Final Project.

Requirements:
- [x] Home Page - Utilize React & Redux to build a page that introduces the site/project
- [x] 'Mine' Page - Build a page called "Mine" which utilizes the GitHub API and fetches the repos for a specific user (you)
- [x] Search Page - Build a page that uses the GitHub API and lets the user search for public repos on GitHub matching the query "Javascript"
  This should run as soon as the page loads (use component lifecycle).

In addition to meeting the requirements, I added styling and the ability to search for _any_ popular public repo. In addition, the 'Mine' page will let you search for public repos by _any_ author, simply supply their GitHub username!
